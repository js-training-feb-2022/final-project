  #Install all packages
- npm i 
  
  ##What I'm use here:
- Redux
- Middleware - redux-thunk  
- Pokemon api
- Try to separate logic and styled components

  ###What you can do:
- Catch and release from any page
- To show images of pokemon on main page

  ###P.S.
But I used one style sheet, because how to say Dan Abramov:
- Do what you need for you feel comfortable in your project
